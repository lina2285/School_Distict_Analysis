# School_Distict_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis

The school board notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth-graders appear to have been altered. Consequently, the board has asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. This analysis required using the Pandas loc method with conditional statements to successfully exclude Thomas High School's ninth-graders. 

Deliverable 1 shows how using the loc method allowed us to retrieve the specific school name and grade for math and reading, and replacing them the grades with NaNs.
