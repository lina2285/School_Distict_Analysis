## Overview of the School District Analysis
### Deliverable 1

The school board notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth-graders appear to have been altered. Consequently, the board has asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. This analysis required using the Pandas loc method with conditional statements to successfully exclude Thomas High School's ninth-graders. 

Deliverable 1 shows how using the loc method allowed us to retrieve the specific school name and grade for math and reading, and replacing them the grades with NaNs.

###Deliverable 2

On Deliverable two, we were able to recalculate all the key metrics excluding the Thomas High School ninth graders and we found that the average decreased upon removing the Thomas High School ninth grade students.  

Differences:

* The original overall passing greade average percentage was 65%, on the revised analysis, the overall passing grade average was 64.9%. 
* 
* Passing math percentage went from 75% to 74.8%
* Passing reading percentage went from 86% to 85.7%

based on the finding of deliverable 2, there is not enough infomation to conclude or confirm that there was academic dishonesty.  The differences in percentage are very close.
